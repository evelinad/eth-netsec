# Topic 9: Security Ecosystem & Detection Failures

- Q: How to handle information about vulnerabilities?
- Options
	- Keep it secret
	- Quietly alert vendor
	- Immediate public full disclosure of all details
	- Sell information
- Full Disclosure
	- Vendor has strong incentive to release a fix
	- All parties get same information, can do risk assessment and mitigation accordingly
- Bug Secrecy
	- If kept secret, nothing happens/changes
	- Vendor eventually releases a parch
- Over the years discovered that full disclosure helps much more than it hurts
- Coordinated Disclosure
	1. Vulnerability discovered
	2. Notify vendor, if collaboration fails do full disclosure
	3. Collaborate with vendor to fix it, if collaboration fails do full disclosure
	4. Coordinated disclosure, if collaboration fails do full disclosure
- Security Information Providers (SIP) watch out for issues and exposes them to the public
	- hard to deny by vendor or government
	- act like free press in open society
