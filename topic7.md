# Topic 7: Web Application Security

## Basics
- Web Applications Anatomy
	- On Client
		- Browser
		- Plug-In's (e.g. Flash, PDF Reader, etc.)
		- Java (e.g. Applets)
		- ActiveX
		- ...
	- Inside DMZ
		- Web Server
		- Server Side Includes
		- CGI, Scripts, Servlets
		- Programs,
		- Plug-In's
		- ...
	- Internal
		- Database Server
		- Business Services
		- Messaging
		- ...
- Threat Vectors
	- Client
		- XSS
		- Phishing
		- Pharming
		- Malware
		- ...
	- DMZ
		- XSS
		- Input Validation
		- Error Messages
		- Google Dorks
		- Response Splitting
		- Authentication
		- Session Management
	- Internal
		- SQL Injection
		- Second Order Code Injection
		- Business Logic

## HTTP and Session Management
- HTTP is a stateless protocol
- State can be added by web application
	- Create session ID on first connection
	- Client stores session ID locally
	- Client sends session ID each time
	- Server identifies client by session ID
- Transfer of session ID
	- HTTP GET Requests
		- (pro) easy to implement
		- (pro) works with cookies disabled
		- (con) session ID part of Browser's history
		- (con) session ID might be logged on intermediate devices (firewalls, proxy, etc.)
		- (con) HTTP REFERER header field reveals session ID to other web servers
	- HTTP POST Request
		- (pro) less obvious than HTTP GET
		- (pro) works with cookies disabled
		- (pro) client can safely store/transmit without revealing session information
		- (con) field seems hidden, but isn't in reality
		- (con) prone to coding errors
	- Cookies
		- (pro) can be restricted to HTTPS only
		- (pro) restricted to domain and path, has an expiration date
		- (con) persistent cookies exist as files on client's system (e.g. might be stolen in internet caf√© setting)
		- (con) users might disable cookies
- Session ID generation
	- Session ID should be hard to guess, even if whole system is known
	- Don't use predictable values (time, date, process ID, client IP) or a hash of them
- Session ID revocation
	- Should be possible to remove session on client and server side
	- Session should be time limited in general (session expires)
	- Server should terminate session after a period of inactivity, in case of misuse or any kind of attack is detected, after an error and when user leaves secure part of the application
	- Client should be able to invalidate its session, so provide a logout mechanism

## Code Injection
- Command/Shell injection targets operating system
- XSS targets browser
- SQL injection targets database
